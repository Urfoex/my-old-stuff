 * "Go is a strategic board game for two players.
 * The game is played by two players who alternately place black and white 
 * stoneson the vacant intersections of a grid of 19×19 lines. The object 
 * of the game is to control a larger portion of the board than the opponent. 
 * A stone or a group of stones is captured and removed if it has no empty 
 * adjacent intersections, the result of being completely surrounded by 
 * stones of the opposing color.
 * 
 *    1. The board is empty at the outset of the game.
 *    2. Black makes the first move, after which he and White alternate.
 *    3. A move consists of placing one stone of one's own color on an empty intersection on the board.
 *    4. A player may pass his turn at any time.
 *    5. A stone or solidly connected group of stones of one color is captured and removed from the board when all the intersections directly adjacent to it are occupied by the enemy. (Capture of the enemy takes precedence over self-capture.)
 *    6. No stone may be played so as to recreate a former board position.
 *    7. Two consecutive passes end the game.
 *    8. A player's territory consists of all the points he has either occupied or surrounded.
 *    9. The player with more territory wins."
